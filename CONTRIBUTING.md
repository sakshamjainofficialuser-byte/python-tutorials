To help your project contributors do good work, you can add a file with contribution guidelines to your project repository's root, docs, or .github folder. When someone opens a pull request or creates an issue, they will see a link to that file. The link to the contributing guidelines also appears on your repository's contribute page. For an example of a contribute page, see github/docs/contribute.

If your repository includes a CONTRIBUTING.md file, GitHub also surfaces it in two other places to make it easier for contributors to discover:

A " Contributing" tab in the repository overview (next to the " README" and " Code of conduct")
A "Contributing" link in the repository sidebar
For the repository owner, contribution guidelines are a way to communicate how people should contribute.

For contributors, the guidelines help them verify that they're submitting well-formed pull requests and opening useful issues.

For both owners and contributors, contribution guidelines save time and hassle caused by improperly created pull requests or issues that have to be rejected and re-submitted.

You can create default contribution guidelines for your organization or personal account. For more information, see Creating a default community health file.

Tip

Repository maintainers can set specific guidelines for issues by creating an issue or pull request template for the repository. For more information, see About issue and pull request templates.
